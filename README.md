# Prosple E2E Test | Playwright JS
This repository contains all of the QA Tests for the Prosple products: Student hub like [GradAustralia](https://gradaustralia.com.au/) and [GradNewZealand](https://gradnewzealand.nz/) and for the [Employer hub](https://portal.prosple.com/). Tests will also be made for the CMS and other Prosple products in the future.

The main framework used for the tests is Playwright JS. To get started, first make sure you have Node JS installed on your machine.

Simply download it from their website: [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/). Once you have Node JS on your Integrated Develpment Environment or IDE like [Visual Studio Code](), go to the terminal and type the code below to download Playwright.

`npm install --save-dev @playwright/test`

The line above will download the dependencies needed. You also will need to download the browsers to use for running the tests.

`npx playwright install`

I also would recommend reading the [Playwright Introduction](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) to help you get started.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask the Prosple QA Engineering team.
